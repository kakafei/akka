 *     "akka.dispatch.BoundedDequeBasedMessageQueueSemantics" = your-custom-mailbox
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, you can add your own requirement marker to the actor and configure a mailbox type to be used
 * for your marker.
 *
 * For a `Stash` based actor that enforces unbounded deques see [[akka.actor.AbstractActorWithUnboundedStash]].
 * There is also an unrestricted version [[akka.actor.AbstractActorWithUnrestrictedStash]] that does not
 * enforce the mailbox type.
